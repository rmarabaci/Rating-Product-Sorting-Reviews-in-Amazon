Improving Amazon product ratings and reviews with the Wilson Lower Bound method.

One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce is accurately calculating product ratings after purchase. Solving this problem means more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, increased product visibility for sellers, and a smoother shopping experience for buyers. Another challenge is accurately ranking product reviews. Since misleading reviews can directly impact product sales, they can lead to both financial losses and customer churn. By addressing these two challenges, e-commerce sites and sellers can increase sales while ensuring that customers have a seamless purchasing journey.
